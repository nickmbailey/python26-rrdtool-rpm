.IX Title "RRDBUILD 1"
.TH RRDBUILD 1 "2008-02-17" "1.2.27" "rrdtool"
.SH "NAME"
rrdbuild \- Instructions for building RRDtool
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.Sh "Overview"
.IX Subsection "Overview"
If you downloaded the source of rrdtool you have to compile it. This
document will give some information on how this is done.
.PP
RRDtool relies on services of thrid part libraries. Some of these libraries
may already be installed on your system. You have to compile copies of the other
ones before you can build RRDtool.
.PP
This document will tell you about all the necessary steps to get going.
.Sh "Building"
.IX Subsection "Building"
Before you start to build RRDtool, you have to decide two things:
.IP "1." 4
In which directory you want to build the software.
.IP "2." 4
Where you want to install the software.
.PP
Once you have decided. Save the two locations into environment variables.
Depending on the shell you are using, you can do either (bash,zsh):
.PP
.Vb 2
\& BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
\& INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/rrdtool\-1.2.27
.Ve
.PP
Or if you run tcsh:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& set BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
\& set INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/rrdtool\-1.2.27
.Ve
.PP
If your \fI/tmp\fR is mounted with the option noexec (\s-1RHEL\s0 seems todo that) you have to choose
a different directory!
.PP
Now make sure the \s-1BUILD_DIR\s0 exists and go there:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& mkdir \-p $BUILD_DIR
\& cd $BUILD_DIR
.Ve
.PP
Lets first assume you already have all the necessary libraries
pre\-installed. Note that these instructions assume that your copies of
\&\fBtar\fR and \fBmake\fR are actually \fB\s-1GNU\s0 tar\fR and \fB\s-1GNU\s0 make\fR respectively. It
could be that they are installed as \fBgtar\fR and \fBgmake\fR on your system.
.PP
.Vb 4
\& wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/rrdtool\-1.2.27.tar.gz
\& tar zxf rrdtool\-1.2.27.tar.gz
\& cd rrdtool\-1.2.27
\& ./configure \-\-prefix=$INSTALL_DIR && make && make install
.Ve
.PP
Ok, this was very optimistic. This try will probably have ended with
\&\fBconfigure\fR complaining about several missing libraries. If you are on a
Linux or *bsd system you may want to just install the missing bits from your
software repository. When you do that, make sure you also get the \fB\-dev\fR
package for each library you install. Once you have the missing bits on
board, just re-run the last line of the instructions above.
.PP
But again this may have been too optimistic, and you actually have to
compile your own copies of the required libraries.
.PP
\fIBuild Tipps for \s-1AIX\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "Build Tipps for AIX"
.PP
If you are woking with \s-1AIX\s0, you may find the the \fB\-\-disable\-shared\fR option
will cause things to break for you. In that case you may have to install the
shared libraries into the rrdtool \s-1PREFIX\s0 and work with \fB\-\-disable\-static\fR
instead.
.PP
Another hint to get rrdtool working on \s-1AIX\s0 is to use the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0 C Compiler:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& export CC=/usr/vac/bin/cc
\& export PERLCC=$CC
.Ve
.PP
(Better instructions for \s-1AIX\s0 welcome!)
.Sh "Building Libraries"
.IX Subsection "Building Libraries"
In order to build the libraries you need a compiler on your system.
Unfortunately compilers are not all alike. This has an effect on the \s-1CFLAGS\s0
you want to set. The examples below are for the popular \s-1GCC\s0 compiler suite.
If you have an other compile you have to use the following settings:
.IP "Sun Forte" 4
.IX Item "Sun Forte"
.Vb 1
\& CFLAGS="\-xO3 \-kPIC"
.Ve
.IP "Building zlib" 4
.IX Item "Building zlib"
.Vb 7
\& cd $BUILD_DIR
\& wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/zlib\-1.2.3.tar.gz
\& tar  zxf zlib\-1.2.3.tar.gz
\& cd zlib\-1.2.3
\& env CFLAGS="\-O3 \-fPIC" ./configure \-\-prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
\& make
\& make install
.Ve
.IP "Building libpng" 4
.IX Item "Building libpng"
Libpng itself requires zlib to build, so we need to help a bit. If you
already have a copy of zlib on your system (which is very likley) you can
drop the settings of \s-1LDFLAGS\s0 and \s-1CPPFLAGS\s0. Note that the backslash (\e) at
the end of line 4 means that line 4 and line 5 are on one line.
.Sp
.Vb 8
\& cd $BUILD_DIR
\& wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libpng\-1.2.10.tar.gz
\& tar zxvf libpng\-1.2.10.tar.gz
\& cd libpng\-1.2.10
\& env CPPFLAGS="\-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include" LDFLAGS="\-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib" CFLAGS="\-O3 \-fPIC" \e
\&     ./configure \-\-disable\-shared \-\-prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
\& make
\& make install
.Ve
.IP "Building freetype" 4
.IX Item "Building freetype"
.Vb 8
\& cd $BUILD_DIR
\& wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/freetype\-2.1.10.tar.bz2
\& tar jxvf freetype\-2.1.10.tar.bz2
\& cd freetype\-2.1.10
\& env CPPFLAGS="\-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include" LDFLAGS="\-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib" CFLAGS="\-O3 \-fPIC" \e
\&     ./configure \-\-disable\-shared \-\-prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
\& make
\& make install
.Ve
.Sp
If you run into problems building freetype on Solaris, you may want to try to
add the following at the end of the configure line:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& GNUMAKE=gmake EGREP=egrep
.Ve
.IP "Building libart_lgpl" 4
.IX Item "Building libart_lgpl"
.Vb 7
\& cd $BUILD_DIR
\& wget http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libart_lgpl\-2.3.17.tar.gz
\& tar zxvf libart_lgpl\-2.3.17.tar.gz
\& cd libart_lgpl\-2.3.17
\& env CFLAGS="\-O3 \-fPIC" ./configure \-\-disable\-shared \-\-prefix=$BUILD_DIR/lb
\& make
\& make install
.Ve
.PP
Now all the dependent libraries are built and you can try again. Since these
are static libraries, you may have to use \fIranlib\fR to make them accessible.
Especially \s-1BSD\s0 systems like Mac \s-1OS\s0 X may require this, Linux and Solaris
will do just fine without since their \fIar\fR command does ranlibs job as well.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ranlib $BUILD_DIR/lb/lib/*.a
.Ve
.PP
This time you tell configure where it should be looking for libraries and
include files. This is done via environment variables. Depending on the
shell you are running, the syntax for setting environment variables is
different. Under csh/tcsh you use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& set IR=\-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include
\& setenv CPPFLAGS "$IR $IR/libart\-2.0 $IR/freetype2 $IR/libpng"
\& setenv LDFLAGS  \-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib
\& setenv CFLAGS \-O3
.Ve
.PP
If you are running bash/sh/ash/ksh/zsh use this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& IR=\-I$BUILD_DIR/lb/include
\& CPPFLAGS="$IR $IR/libart\-2.0 $IR/freetype2 $IR/libpng"
\& LDFLAGS="\-L$BUILD_DIR/lb/lib"
\& CFLAGS=\-O3
\& export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS CFLAGS
.Ve
.PP
And finally try building again. We disable the python and tcl bindings
because it seems that a fair number of people have ill configured python and
tcl setups that would prevent rrdtool from building if they are included in
their current state.
.PP
.Vb 5
\& cd $BUILD_DIR/rrdtool\-1.2.27
\& ./configure \-\-prefix=$INSTALL_DIR \-\-disable\-python \-\-disable\-tcl
\& make clean
\& make
\& make install
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1SOLARIS\s0 \s-1HINT:\s0 if you want to build  the perl module for the native perl (the
one shipping with solaris) you will need the sun forte compiler
installed on your box or you have to hand-tune bindings/perl\-shared/Makefile
while building!
.PP
Now go to \fI$INSTALL_DIR\fR\fB/share/rrdtool/examples/\fR and run them to see if your
build has been successful.
