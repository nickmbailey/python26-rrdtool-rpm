       These instructions allow you to generate your image or report.  If you
       don't use any graph elements, no graph is generated.  Similarly, no
       report is generated if you don't use print options.

       PPRRIINNTT::_v_n_a_m_e::_f_o_r_m_a_t[::ssttrrffttiimmee]
           Depending on the context, either the value component or the time
           component of a VVDDEEFF is printed using _f_o_r_m_a_t. It is an error to
           specify a _v_n_a_m_e generated by a DDEEFF or CCDDEEFF.

           Any text in _f_o_r_m_a_t is printed literally with one exception: The
           percent character introduces a formatter string. This string can
           be:

           For printing values:

           %%%% - just prints a literal '%' character

           %%##..##llee - prints numbers like 1.2346e+04. The optional integers #
           denote field width and decimal precision.

           %%##..##llff - prints numbers like 12345.6789, with optional field width
           and precision.

           %%ss - place this after %%llee, %%llff or %%llgg. This will be replaced by the
           appropriate SI magnitude unit and the value will be scaled accord-
           ingly (123456 -> 123.456 k).

           %%SS - is similar to %%ss. It does, however, use a previously defined
           magnitude unit. If there is no such unit yet, it tries to define
           one (just like %%ss) unless the value is zero, in which case the
           magnitude unit stays undefined. Thus, formatter strings using %%SS
           and no %%ss will all use the same magnitude unit except for zero val-
           ues.

           If you PRINT a VDEF value, you can also print the time associated
           with it by appending the string ::ssttrrffttiimmee to the format. Note that
           rrdtool uses the strftime function of your OSs clibrary. This means
           that the conversion specifier may vary. Check the manual page if
           you are uncertain. The following is a list of conversion specifiers
           usually supported across the board.

           %%aa - The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.

           %%AA - The full weekday name according to the current locale.

           %%bb - The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

           %%BB - The full month name according to the current locale.

           %%cc - The preferred date and time representation for the current
           locale.

           %%dd - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

           %%HH - The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00
           to 23).

           %%II - The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01
           to 12).

           %%jj - The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).

           %%mm - The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).

           %%MM - The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).

           %%pp - Either `AM' or `PM' according to the given time value, or the
           corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as
           `pm' and midnight as `am'.  Note that in many locales and `pm'
           notation is unsupported and in such cases %p will return an empty
           string.

           %%SS - The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).

           %%UU - The  week  number  of  the current year as a decimal number,
           range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of
           week 01. See also %V and %W.

           %%VV - The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal
           number, range 01 to  53,  where week  1 is the first week that has
           at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first
           day of the week. See also %U and %W.

           %%ww - The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being
           0.  See also %u.

           %%WW - The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range
           00 to  53,  starting  with  the first Monday as the first day of
           week 01.

           %%xx - The preferred date representation for the current locale with-
           out the time.

           %%XX - The preferred time representation for the current locale with-
           out the date.

           %%yy - The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to
           99).

           %%YY - The year as a decimal number including the century.

           %%ZZ - The time zone or name or abbreviation.

           %%%% - A literal `%' character.

       CCOOMMMMEENNTT::_t_e_x_t
           Text is printed literally in the legend section of the graph. Note
           that in RRDtool 1.2 you have to escape colons in COMMENT text in
           the same way you have to escape them in **PPRRIINNTT commands by writing
           ''\\::''.

       VVRRUULLEE::_t_i_m_e##_c_o_l_o_r [::_l_e_g_e_n_d ]
           Draw a vertical line at _t_i_m_e.  Its color is composed from three
           hexadecimal numbers specifying the rgb color components (00 is off,
           FF is maximum) red, green and blue followed by an optional alpha.
           Optionally, a legend box and string is printed in the legend sec-
           tion. _t_i_m_e may be a number or a variable from a VVDDEEFF. It is an
           error to use _v_n_a_m_es from DDEEFF or CCDDEEFF here.

       HHRRUULLEE::_v_a_l_u_e##_c_o_l_o_r [ :_l_e_g_e_n_d ]
           Draw a horizontal line at _v_a_l_u_e.  HRULE acts much like LINE except
           that will have no effect on the scale of the graph. If a HRULE is
           outside the graphing area it will just not be visible.

       LLIINNEE[_w_i_d_t_h]::_v_a_l_u_e[##_c_o_l_o_r][::[_l_e_g_e_n_d][::SSTTAACCKK]]
           Draw a line of the specified width onto the graph. _w_i_d_t_h can be a
           floating point number. If the color is not specified, the drawing
           is done 'invisibly'. This is useful when stacking something else on
           top of this line. Also optional is the legend box and string which
           will be printed in the legend section if specified. The vvaalluuee can
           be generated by DDEEFF, VVDDEEFF, and CCDDEEFF.  If the optional SSTTAACCKK modi-
           fier is used, this line is stacked on top of the previous element
           which can be a LLIINNEE or an AARREEAA.

           When you do not specify a color, you cannot specify a legend.
           Should you want to use STACK, use the "LINEx:<value>::STACK" form.

       AARREEAA::_v_a_l_u_e[##_c_o_l_o_r][::[_l_e_g_e_n_d][::SSTTAACCKK]]
           See LLIINNEE, however the area between the x-axis and the line will be
           filled.

       TTIICCKK::_v_n_a_m_e##_r_r_g_g_b_b[_a_a][::_f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n[::_l_e_g_e_n_d]]
           Plot a tick mark (a vertical line) for each value of _v_n_a_m_e that is
           non-zero and not *UNKNOWN*. The _f_r_a_c_t_i_o_n argument specifies the
           length of the tick mark as a fraction of the y-axis; the default
           value is 0.1 (10% of the axis). Note that the color specification
           is not optional. The TICK marks normaly start at the lower edge of
           the graphing area. If the fraction is negative they start at the
           upper border of the graphing area.

       SSHHIIFFTT::_v_n_a_m_e::_o_f_f_s_e_t
           Using this command RRRRDDttooooll will graph the following elements with
           the specified offset.  For instance, you can specify an offset of
           ( 7*24*60*60 = ) 604'800 seconds to "look back" one week. Make sure
           to tell the viewer of your graph you did this ...  As with the
           other graphing elements, you can specify a number or a variable
           here.

       SSTTAACCKK::_v_n_a_m_e##_c_o_l_o_r[::_l_e_g_e_n_d]

       When stacking, an element is not placed above the X-axis but rather on
       top of the previous element.  There must be something to stack upon.

       You can use an iinnvviissiibbllee LINE or AREA to stacked upon.

       An uunnkknnoowwnn value makes the entire stack unknown from that moment on.
       You don't know where to begin (the unknown value) and therefore do not
       know where to end.

       If you want to make sure you will be displaying a certain variable,
       make sure never to stack upon the unknown value.  Use a CDEF instruc-
       tion with IIFF and UUNN to do so.

       EEssccaappiinngg tthhee ccoolloonn

       A colon ':' in a _l_e_g_e_n_d argument will mark the end of the legend. To
       enter a ':' as part of a legend, the colon must be escaped with a back-
       slash '\:'.  Beware that many environments process backslashes them-
       selves, so it may be necessary to write two backslashes in order to one
       being passed onto rrd_graph.

       SSttrriinngg FFoorrmmaattttiinngg

       The text printed below the actual graph can be formatted by appending
       special escape characters at the end of a text. When ever such a char-
       acter occurs, all pending text is pushed onto the graph according to
       the character specified.

       Valid markers are: \\jj for justified, \\ll for left aligned, \\rr for right
       aligned, and \\cc for centered. In the next section there is an example
       showing how to use centered formatting.

       \\nn is a valid alias for \\ll since incomplete parsing in earlier versions
       of rrdtool lead to this behaviour and a number of people has been using
       it.

       Normally there are two space characters inserted between every two
       items printed into the graph. The space following a string can be sup-
       pressed by putting a \\gg at the end of the string. The \\gg also ignores
       any space inside the string if it is at the very end of the string.
       This can be used in connection with %%ss to suppress empty unit strings.

        GPRINT:a:MAX:%lf%s\g

       A special case is COMMENT:\\ss which inserts some additional vertical
       space before placing the next row of legends.

       If you are using the proportional font in your graph, you can use tab
       characters or the sequence \\tt to line-up legend elements. Note that the
       tabs inserted are relative to the start of the current legend element!
